## Description
In this quiz, players will be timed for one minute to answer three questions. After selecting an answer, the following question will appear, however, selecting a wrong answer will result in losing ten seconds of time for completing the quiz. Once the quiz is completed, the player's score will be displayed, and the player's initials must be submitted to store the score in the highscore section. The 'back' button will refresh the page and restart the game, and the 'clear highscore button' clears the local storage.

### Notes
The Javascript code turned out to be long and complicated at times. Once most of the functions were complete, I had to restructure the HTMl and Javascript file make a dynamic display of the quiz with cleaner coding. This was a step backwords in order to get two steps forward in my coding process. This process reduced my html code and made the interactive quiz based on a variable object of arrays. Ultimately, the application appeared better in the long run.
